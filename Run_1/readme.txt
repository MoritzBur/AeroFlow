This is a validation case containing only a finite NACA0012 wing.
For more information, see the developer documentation of AeroFlow.

If you want to test the toolbox using an Ansys student licence, run this case using the _coarse input files.
This will most likely not produce a converging solution, but you will stay below the 512k cell limit and see how the tool works.
